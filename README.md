### üí° My System Design Philosophy

I design and implement end-to-end systems that bridge the gap between software and real-world industrial processes. My solutions typically integrate:

* üåê **Web & API Applications** (`ASP.NET Core`, `Java Spring`, `SQL Server`)
* üêç **Data Automation** (`Python-based data automation and analytics tools`)
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Hardware Integration** (`Embedded and IoT solutions` with ESP32 and industrial sensors)

My focus is on building **scalable, intelligent, and hardware-aware applications**.
