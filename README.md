# Hello! I'm Mehmet 👋

### 🎓 Title: Full Stack Developer & Computer Technologies Lecturer
---

I’m a **Full Stack Developer and Computer Technologies Lecturer** with **20+ years of experience** in software development, industrial automation, and IoT systems.

### 🛠️ Core Expertise

My expertise spans modern programming languages, combining deep knowledge of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** with practical experience in high-value, niche fields:

* **Industrial Automation:** Machine Vision, PLC Communication (Modbus TCP), IoT Systems.
* **Artificial Intelligence:** AI-based Automation, Image Recognition.

### ⚙️ Technologies & Languages

I have in-depth experience across the following languages and frameworks:

### 💡 My System Design Philosophy

I design and implement end-to-end systems that bridge the gap between software and real-world industrial processes. My solutions typically integrate:

* 🌐 **Web & API Applications** (`ASP.NET Core`, `Java Spring`, `SQL Server`)
* 🐍 **Data Automation** (`Python-based data automation and analytics tools`)
* ⚙️ **Hardware Integration** (`Embedded and IoT solutions` with ESP32 and industrial sensors)

My focus is on building **scalable, intelligent, and hardware-aware applications**.
